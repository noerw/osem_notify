# osem_notify ðŸ”†ðŸŒ¡ðŸ“¡ðŸ“ˆ  âš  ðŸ“²

Cross platform command line application to run health checks against sensor stations registered on [openSenseMap.org](https://opensensemap.org).

This tool lets you automatically check if senseBoxes are still runnning correctly,
and when that's not the case, notifies you.
Currently, email notifications are implemented, but other transports can be added easily.
Implemented health checks are [described below](#possible-values-for-defaulthealthchecksevents), and new ones can be added just as easily (given some knowledge of programming).

The tool has multiple modes of operation:

- `osem_notify check boxes`: run one-off checks on boxes
- `osem_notify watch boxes`: check boxes continuously

Run `osem_notify help` or check the manual in the [docs/](docs/osem_notify.md) directory for more details.

## get it
Download a build from the [releases page](https://github.com/noerw/osem_notify/releases/).
You can run the application by running `./osem_notify*` in a terminal in your downloads directory.

On unix platforms you may need to make it executable, and can add it to your `$PATH` for convenience, so it is always callable via `osem_notify`:
```sh
chmod +x osem_notify*
sudo mv osem_notify* /usr/bin/osem_notify
```

## configure it
The tool works out of the box for basic functionality, but must be configured to set up notifications.

Configuration can be done via a YAML file located at `~/.osem_notify.yml` or through environment variables.
Example configuration:

```yaml
# override default health checks:
defaultHealthchecks:
  notifications:
    transport: email
    options:
      recipients:
      - fridolina@example.com
      - ruth.less@example.com
  events:
    - type: "measurement_age"
      target: "all"    # all sensors
      threshold: "15m" # any duration
    - type: "measurement_faulty"
      target: "all"
      threshold: ""

# only needed when sending notifications via email
email:
  host: smtp.example.com
  port: 25
  user: foo
  pass: bar
  from: hildegunst@example.com
```

### possible values for `defaultHealthchecks.notifications`:
`transport` | `options`
------------|------------
`email`     | `recipients`: list of email addresses

### possible values for `defaultHealthchecks.events[]`:

`type`               | description
---------------------|------------
`measurement_age`    | Alert when sensor `target` has not submitted measurements within `threshold` duration.
`measurement_faulty` | Alert when sensor `target`'s last reading was a presumably faulty value (e.g. broken / disconnected sensor).
`measurement_min`    | Alert when sensor `target`'s last measurement is lower than `threshold`.
`measurement_max`    | Alert when sensor `target`'s last measurement is higher than `threshold`.

`target` can be either a sensor ID, or `"all"` to match all sensors of the box.
`threshold` must be a string.

### configuration via environment variables
Instead of a YAML file, you may configure the tool through environment variables. Keys are the same as in the YAML, but:

- prefixed with `OSEM_NOTIFY_`
- path separator is not `.`, but `_`
- all upper case

Example: `OSEM_NOTIFY_EMAIL_PASS=supersecret osem_notify check boxes`

## build it
Want to use `osem_notify` on a platform where no builds are provided?

Assuming you have golang installed, run
```sh
go get -v -d ./
go build main.go
```

For cross-compilation, check [this guide](https://dave.cheney.net/2015/08/22/cross-compilation-with-go-1-5) out.

## contribute
Contributions are welcome!
